# moleculeMaker
tiny, 3D printable, and free factories for molecules

a place to put my openscad codes for:
- SAR reactor (alpha done)
- manifold (in progress)
- settler (should use some of the manifold code)
- tubular HxE (later)

- openfoam simulations

- pump models and testing results

- printed plant + pump testing results

enjoy my rotten code!
